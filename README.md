# HTML_Webscraping_Challenge 
 
In this exercise, I used the Mars Planet Science website to scrape data about Mars’. Tools used in this exercise are Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

## Findings

Based on the data, on average the third month is the coldest in Mars, while the eight month is the hottest.

Mars atmospheric pressure is the lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth month.

According to NASA there are 687 earth days in a Martian year. A year is defined by how long it takes for the planet to orbit the sun, in the Mars Daily Minimum Temperature diagram it is represented from peak to peak. Based on the Mars Daily Minimum Temperature diagram, I estimate 675 earth days in a Martian year. This estimate is derived from 800 -125 = 675 (peak 2-peak 1) or 1475 – 800 = 675 (peak 3- peak 2).
